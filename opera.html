    <h3 style="color:violet">Act 2: Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h3>
    <h4 class="margiu"> MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</h4>

        SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria. Marco and<br>
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,<br>
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre. The Gondoliers<br>
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,<br>
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various<br>
        degrees. All are enjoying themselves without reference to social<br>
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some<br>
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.<br>
    
      <p>
        <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your<br>
        expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much<br>
        obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good<br>
        feeling.<br>
        <h6 class="all">ALL.</h6>
         We heard you.<br>
        <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
        We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with<br>
        sentiments so charmingly expressed.<br>
        <h6 class="all">ALL.</h6>
         That's all right.<br>
        <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
         At the same time there is just one little grievance<br>
        that we should like to ventilate.<br>
        <h6 class="all">ALL.</h6>
         (angrily). What?<br>
        <h6 class="giu">MAR.</h6>
         Don't be alarmed—it's not serious. It is arranged<br>
        that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we<br>
        are to act as one person.<br>
        <h6 class=gio">GIORGIO.</h6>
         Exactly.<br>
        <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
         Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point<br>
        of fact, two persons.<br>
        <h6 class="anni">ANNIBALE.</h6>
         Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a<br>
        legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as<br>
        we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.<br>
        <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
         No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.<br>
        It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you<br>
        supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it<br>
        as a legal fiction carried a little too far.<br>

            (Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace. As soon as
            they have disappeared, Luiz and Casilda rush to each other
            arms.)
         </p>
        <p>
           RECITATIVE AND DUET—CASILDA AND LUIZ.

             O rapture, when alone together
             Two loving hearts and those that bear them
             May join in temporary tether,
             Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.
        </p>
        <h6 class="cas">CAS.</h6>
        Necessity, Invention's mother,
        Compelled me to a course of feigning—
        But, left alone with one another,
        I will atone for my disdaining!
    
        <h6 class="luiz">LUIZ.</h6>
        Ah, well-beloved,
        Thy cold disdain,
        It gives no pain—
        'Tis mercy, played
        In masquerade!
    
        <h6 class="both">BOTH.</h6>
        Ah, well-beloved, etc.

        <p class="song">
            SONG—GIUSEPPE with CHORUS.
            Rising early in the morning,
          We proceed to light the fire,
          Then our Majesty adorning
           In its workaday attire,
            We embark without delay
            On the duties of the day.
          First, we polish off some batches
          Of political despatches,
          And foreign politicians circumvent;
           Then, if business isn't heavy,
           We may hold a Royal levee,
          Or ratify some Acts of Parliament.
         Then we probably review the household troops—
         With the usual "Shalloo humps!" and "Shalloo hoops!"
         Or receive with ceremonial and state
         An interesting Eastern potentate.
         After that we generally
         Go and dress our private valet—
        (It's a rather nervous duty—he's a touchy little man)—
         Write some letters literary
        For our private secretary—
        He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.
        Then, in view of cravings inner,
        We go down and order dinner;
       Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate—
       Spend an hour in titivating
       All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;
       Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.
       Oh, philosophers may sing
       Of the troubles of a King;
       Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;
       But the privilege and pleasure
       That we treasure beyond measure
       Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.
       CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.
       After luncheon (making merry
       On a bun and glass of sherry)
       If we've nothing in particular to do,
       We may make a Proclamation,
        Or receive a deputation
       Then we possibly create a Peer or two.
       Then we help a fellow-creature on his path
        With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,
         Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state
         To a festival, a function, or a fete.
        Then we go and stand as sentry
        At the Palace (private entry),
        Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and
        fro,
        While the warrior on duty
        Goes in search of beer and beauty
        (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).
        He relieves us, if he's able,
        Just in time to lay the table,
        Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve
        or one,
        With a pleasure that's emphatic,
        We retire to our attic
        With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!
       Oh, philosophers may sing
        Of the troubles of a King,
        But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are
        none;
        And the culminating pleasure
        That we treasure beyond measure
        Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!

        CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Exeunt all but Marco and<br>
            Giuseppe.)<br>\

    <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
      Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're<br>
      all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them<br>
      wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my<br>
      turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and<br>
      never seem to grudge it.
    <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
    It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like<br>
    taking advantage of their good nature.<br>
    <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
    How nice they were about the double rations.<br>
    <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
    Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting<br>
    to make us thoroughly comfortable.<br>
    <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
    And that is?<br>
    <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
    The dear little wives we left behind us three months<br>
    ago.<br>
    <h6 class="giu">GIU.</h6>
    Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do<br>
    without everything else, but we can't do without that.<br>
    <h6 class="mar">MAR.</h6>
    And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.<br>
    There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.<br>


        <p class="song">
            SONG—MARCO.<br>
            Take a pair of sparkling eyes,<br>
            Hidden, ever and anon,<br>
           In a merciful eclipse—<br>
         Do not heed their mild surprise—<br>
            Having passed the Rubicon,<br>
                 Take a pair of rosy lips;<br>
        Take a figure trimly planned—<br>
            Such as admiration whets—<br>
                 (Be particular in this);<br>
         Take a tender little hand,<br>
            Fringed with dainty fingerettes,<br>
                 Press it—in parenthesis;—<br>
            Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—<br>
           Take and keep them, if you can!<br>
           <br>
          Take a pretty little cot—<br>
            Quite a miniature affair—<br>
                 Hung about with trellised vine,<br>
           Furnish it upon the spot<br>
            With the treasures rich and rare<br>
                 I've endeavoured to define.<br>
               Live to love and love to live—<br>
            You will ripen at your ease,<br>
                 Growing on the sunny side—<br>
            Fate has nothing more to give.<br>
            You're a dainty man to please<br>
                 If you are not satisfied.<br>
          Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;<br>
          Act upon it, if you can!<br>
        <br>
        (Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and<br>

        Here we are, at the risk of our lives,<br>
        From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—<br>
