    <h3 style="color:violet">Act 2: Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h3>
    <h4 class="margiu"> MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</h4>
    <h4>
    <br>
        SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria. Marco and<br>
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,<br>
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre. The Gondoliers<br>
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,<br>
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various<br>
        degrees. All are enjoying themselves without reference to social<br>
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some<br>
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.<br>
        <br>
    </h4>
      <p>
        <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
        <p class="speech">Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your<br>
        expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much<br>
        obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good<br>
        feeling.<br>
        <h4 class="all">ALL.</h4>
        ALL. We heard you.<br>
        <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
        MAR. We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with<br>
        sentiments so charmingly expressed.<br>
        <h4 class="all">ALL.</h4>
        ALL. That's all right.<br>
        <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
        GIU. At the same time there is just one little grievance<br>
        that we should like to ventilate.<br>
        <h4 class="all">ALL.</h4>
        ALL (angrily). What?<br>
        <h4 class="giu">MAR.</h4>
        GIU. Don't be alarmed—it's not serious. It is arranged<br>
        that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we<br>
        are to act as one person.<br>
        <h4 class=gio">GIORGIO.</h4>
        GIORGIO. Exactly.<br>
        <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
        GIU. Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point<br>
        of fact, two persons.<br>
        <h4 class="anni">ANNIBALE.</h4>
        ANNIBALE. Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a<br>
        legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as<br>
        we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.<br>
        <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
        GIU. No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.<br>
        It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you<br>
        supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it<br>
        as a legal fiction carried a little too far.<br>

            (Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace. As soon as
            they have disappeared, Luiz and Casilda rush to each other's

           RECITATIVE AND DUET—CASILDA AND LUIZ.

             O rapture, when alone together
             Two loving hearts and those that bear them
             May join in temporary tether,
             Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cas">CAS.</h4>
        Necessity, Invention's mother,
        Compelled me to a course of feigning—
        But, left alone with one another,
        I will atone for my disdaining!
    
        <h4 class="luiz">LUIZ.</h4>
        Ah, well-beloved,
        Thy cold disdain,
        It gives no pain—
        'Tis mercy, played
        In masquerade!
    
        <h4 class="both">BOTH.</h4>
        Ah, well-beloved, etc.

        <p class="song">
            SONG—GIUSEPPE with CHORUS.<br>
            Rising early in the morning,<br>
          We proceed to light the fire,<br>
          Then our Majesty adorning<br>
           In its workaday attire,<br>
            We embark without delay<br>
            On the duties of the day.<br>
          First, we polish off some batches<br>
          Of political despatches,<br>
          And foreign politicians circumvent;<br>
           Then, if business isn't heavy,<br>
           We may hold a Royal levee,<br>
          Or ratify some Acts of Parliament.<br>
         Then we probably review the household troops—<br>
         With the usual "Shalloo humps!" and "Shalloo hoops!"<br>
         Or receive with ceremonial and state<br>
         An interesting Eastern potentate.<br>
         After that we generally<br>
         Go and dress our private valet—<br>
        (It's a rather nervous duty—he's a touchy little man)—<br>
         Write some letters literary<br>
        For our private secretary—<br>
        He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.<br>
        Then, in view of cravings inner,<br>
        We go down and order dinner;<br>
       Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate—<br>
       Spend an hour in titivating<br>
       All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;<br>
       Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.<br>
       Oh, philosophers may sing<br>
       Of the troubles of a King;<br>
       Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;<br>
       But the privilege and pleasure<br>
       That we treasure beyond measure<br>
       Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.<br>
       CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.
       After luncheon (making merry<br>
       On a bun and glass of sherry)<br>
       If we've nothing in particular to do,<br>
       We may make a Proclamation,<br>
        Or receive a deputation<br>
       Then we possibly create a Peer or two.<br>
       Then we help a fellow-creature on his path<br>
        With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,<br>
         Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state<br>
         To a festival, a function, or a fete.<br>
        Then we go and stand as sentry<br>
        At the Palace (private entry),<br>
        Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and<br>
        fro,<br>
        While the warrior on duty<br>
        Goes in search of beer and beauty<br>
        (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).<br>
        He relieves us, if he's able,<br>
        Just in time to lay the table,<br>
        Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve<br>
        or one,<br>
        With a pleasure that's emphatic,<br>
        We retire to our attic<br>
        With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!<br>
       Oh, philosophers may sing<br>
        Of the troubles of a King,<br>
        But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are<br>
        none;<br>
        And the culminating pleasure<br>
        That we treasure beyond measure<br>
        Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!<b>

        CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.

    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
      Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're<br>
      all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them<br>
      wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my<br>
      turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and<br>
      never seem to grudge it.
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like<br>
    taking advantage of their good nature.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    How nice they were about the double rations.<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting<br>
    to make us thoroughly comfortable.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    And that is?<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    The dear little wives we left behind us three months<br>
    ago.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do<br>
    without everything else, but we can't do without that.<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.<br>
    There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.<br>

            SONG—MARCO.<br>
            Take a pair of sparkling eyes,<br>
            Hidden, ever and anon,<br>
           In a merciful eclipse—<br>
         Do not heed their mild surprise—<br>
            Having passed the Rubicon,<br>
                 Take a pair of rosy lips;<br>
        Take a figure trimly planned—<br>
            Such as admiration whets—<br>
                 (Be particular in this);<br>
         Take a tender little hand,<br>
            Fringed with dainty fingerettes,<br>
                 Press it—in parenthesis;—<br>
            Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—<br>
           Take and keep them, if you can!<br>
           <br>
          Take a pretty little cot—<br>
            Quite a miniature affair—<br>
                 Hung about with trellised vine,<br>
           Furnish it upon the spot<br>
            With the treasures rich and rare<br>
                 I've endeavoured to define.<br>

            You will ripen at your ease,<br>
                 Growing on the sunny side—<br>
            Fate has nothing more to give.<br>
            You're a dainty man to please<br>
                 If you are not satisfied.<br>
          Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;<br>
