    <h3>The Gondoliers Act 2</h3>
    <h4>
        ACT II<br>
        SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria. Marco and<br>
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,<br>
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre. The Gondoliers<br>
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,<br>
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various<br>
        degrees. All are enjoying themselves without reference to social<br>
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some<br>
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.<br>
    </h4>
      <p>
        MAR. Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
        expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
        obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
        feeling.<br>
        ALL. We heard you.<br>
        MAR. We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
        sentiments so charmingly expressed.<br>
        ALL. That's all right.<br>
        GIU. At the same time there is just one little grievance
        that we should like to ventilate.<br>
        ALL (angrily). What?<br>
        GIU. Don't be alarmed—it's not serious. It is arranged
        that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
        are to act as one person.<br>
        GIORGIO. Exactly.<br>
        GIU. Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
        of fact, two persons.<br>
        ANNIBALE. Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a
        legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as
        we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.<br>
        GIU. No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.
        It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you
        supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it
        as a legal fiction carried a little too far.<br>
